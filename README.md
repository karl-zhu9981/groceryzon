Groceryzon by Karl Zhu

## What it does
Customers can select the store that they wish to go, and book an available time for that store. Then they will get a QR code to their
email, allowing them be scanned and allowed into the store. Grocery store retailers can make an account on our web app, and register 
their stores, along with the carrying capacity per hour for the store. When customers book a time, retailers can login to their account, 
and scan the customer's QR code, thus verifying the booking and allowing entry. 

## The Breakdown
A web app where customers can choose the store they want to shop at, the time they want to go, and the number of people.

Vendors are able to register and then create stores with the capacity per hour, so that customers can have a variety of stores to choose from. 

If the time that they choose has more than the number of people allowed as per social distancing rules for that store, they must choose another time, or another store.

The customer then receive the QR code via email, and brings it to the store, where the vendor can then read that code, checking the customer in.
